# rjw [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/75263feb-bf82-45f0-9a4f-a0cc9493d337/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/affectionate-ardinghelli-67d56c/deploys)

This is a small website for displaying random Japanese words, where the kana is
in bigger font so I can practice writing random words.

All the words are from [Usagi-Chan's Genki Resource Page][0] and none of the
words are actually stored in this repository but consumed via [Sheety][1].

Quick start:

```
$ yarn
$ yarn run dev
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ npm run watch
```
